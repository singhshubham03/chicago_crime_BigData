# Crime Data Time Series Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing crime data using time series analysis techniques, specifically using the Prophet library. The goal is to explore the patterns and trends in crime data over time and make future crime count predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Chicago Crime Data" dataset, which contains information about crimes reported in Chicago from 2012 to 2017. The dataset provides details such as crime type, description, location, arrest status, etc.

## Project Structure

The project repository has the following structure:


## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/singhshubham03/chicago_crime_BigData.git
   
 2.Install the required dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 3. Download the dataset file Chicago_Crime_Data.csv and place it in the data/ directory.
 4. Open the Jupyter notebook notebooks/Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb to explore the time series analysis using Prophet.

## Time Series Analysis

The time series analysis is performed using the Prophet library, a powerful tool for time series forecasting. The notebook Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb contains the code and step-by-step explanations for the analysis.

## The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for time series analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the crime data, identifying patterns, and understanding the underlying characteristics.
3. Modeling with Prophet: Building a time series model using the Prophet library, training the model on historical crime data, and making future predictions.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance and analyzing the predicted crime counts.

## Results and Findings

The time series analysis reveals valuable insights into the crime patterns and trends in Chicago. The Prophet model provides predictions for future crime counts, allowing for proactive measures and resource allocation in addressing crime prevention and law enforcement.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of time series analysis techniques using Prophet for crime data analysis. By understanding the patterns and making predictions, it enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and take proactive actions in managing and reducing crime rates.
